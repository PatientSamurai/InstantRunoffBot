# Overview

InstantRunoffBot is a Discord chat bot that allows you to hold instant runoff elections
in your Discord channel. All you have to do is list all your candidates, decorate the
messages with some reactions so the bot can parse them, have your users react to them
with their ordered preferences and then set the bot free. The bot will quickly run an
instant runoff election and tell you which candidate wins and also show you its work!

# Usage

To run an election:
1. Enter some kind of "start" message into your channel.
    - The content of the message isn't important.
    - Add the 'beginner' reaction (🔰) to mark that it's the start message.
2. List each of your candidates as separate messages.
    - Add a checkmark reaction to each candidate. e.g. 'white_check_mark' (✅).
    - The bot will trim all non-alphanumeric characters from the starts and ends so dress the text up however you would like.
    - Who sends the message isn't important so you can have your users nominate their own candidates too.
3. Have all of your voters react to each candidate with their preference order.
    - Use the 'one', 'two', 'three' etc. reactions (1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣) to mark the user's first, second, third etc. preferences.
    - 'zero' (0️⃣) counts as the user's tenth option
    - Having more than 10 candidates is supported, but having a voter rank more than 10 options is not.
    - Voters may stop ranking once they no longer care about the ordering of the remaining candidates.
    - Voters voting twice on the same candidate, or voting the same rank on multiple candidates will be detected and will cause an error message.
4. Once all votes are in, optionally run the '!vote audit' command.
    - '!vote audit' will have the bot parse the election and parrot it back in chat.
    - If the bot detects any voting errors, they will be displayed at this time.
5. Once you wish to run the tabulation, use the '!vote tabulate' command.
    - If you define a role with the name 'ElectionAdmin', the bot will enforce only users with that role can run this command.
    - If the role 'ElectionAdmin' is not defined in your server, the bot will allow anyone to run this command.
    - The bot will run an instant runoff election and narrow down the candidates to a single winner.
    - The bot will tell you every step it takes and then display the winner.
    - The bot will mark the winning candidate with a 'trophy' reaction (🏆).
    - The bot will mark the starting message with a 'checkered_flag' reaction (🏁) to mark the election as complete.
6. The '!vote reset' command will reset the most recent election so that it can be run again.
    - This command also requires the 'ElectionAdmin' role if it exists.
7. The '!vote help' command will print usage commands.

How instant runoff voting is handled:
1. If there are currently any candidates with a majority of the remaining #1 votes, that candidate wins.
2. If there is no candidate with a majority of the remaining #1 votes, the bot will pick one or more candidates to remove:
    1. If there is a single candidate that has the least number of #1 votes, the bot will eliminate that candidate.
    2. If there are multiple candidates tied with the least number of #1 votes, and the sum of their votes is lower than the next highest top vote winner, they are all removed.
    3. If this is not the case, a random candidate with the lowest number of top votes is removed.
5. Once the bot has removed a loser(s), the bot will defragment all the voters' remaining votes to make sure every voter's votes are promoted.
6. Loop to step 1.

# Development

## Add bot to server
You can add the bot to your server using this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=68672. Replace the client_id parameter with your own client ID.

The value of 68672 for permissions corresponds with 0x10C40:
- 0x40 (Add reactions) |
- 0x400 (Read messages) |
- 0x800 (Send messages) |
- 0x10000 (Read message history)
which is the minimal set of permissions required for the bot to work properly.
